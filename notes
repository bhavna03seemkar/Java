//homework problems
1. Try to declare meaningful variables of each type. 
Eg - a variable named age should be a numeric type (int or float) not byte.
2. Make a program that takes the radius of a circle as input, 
calculates its radius and area and prints it as output to the user.
3. Make a program that prints the table of a number that is input 
by the user. 
(HINT - You will have to write 10 lines for this but as we proceed in the course you will be studying about ‘LOOPS’ that will simplify your work A LOT!)
